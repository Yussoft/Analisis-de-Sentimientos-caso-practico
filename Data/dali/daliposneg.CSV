When you go to the train station in Barcelona (Sants), you will have two options: the fast train or RENFE. I personally took RENFE, because I paid for a two way trip only 24 euros! It takes around 2 hours to get there by train. You do NOT buy the tickets before the day of the travel. You just show up to the train station and go between counters 1-6 and ask for a two way ticket to Figueres. The great thing is that there is no time printed on the ticket, so you can take the train whenever you like. When in Figueres, it is very easy to find the museum by just following the signs. To be honest, I pretty much knew I wanted to go to this Museum, but then after going there, I can't believe how much people miss out on, by not visiting this museum. I find the price to be pretty cheap for what it offers (reduced 10 euros, normal price 14 euros). This museum is different from other museums, as it does not merely display Dali's works, but the Theatre-Museum ITSELF, IS a work of Dali!

The huge domed area undercover has huge large paintings and then there are a series of rooms showing the many different stage of his work from the early surreal to the thoughtful war painting period.  My favourite part was the Dali jewels which is housed in a separate side of the building with a small entrance. One person enters at a time via a revolving door so the drama is immediate. Once inside it's darkly lit and each case shows his amazing jewellery designs with many of his sketches by the side to show his plan of each piece - fantastic! I As you an imagine these are no ordinary sets of earrings and necklaces and some have clockwork movement.  I can't speak highly enough of this visit and if you are in Girona or Barcelona or over the border close by in France it's well worth a drive. In the town there are plenty of lovely restaurants to make a day of it or go to his house nearby - sadly we didn't have time on this trip.  If I had one criticism I would have liked more information about the paintings. The entry was very busy and I didn't see any guide books and sometimes walking from room to room there wasn't a great deal of explanation and it was all so intriguing I wanted to know more.","positive","negative",7,9

Interestingly, the museum does not offer docents or audio guides to provide any explanation for what you will see.

It is definitely diferrent from everything I have previously seen in museums. Even his works, because in this setting, they just seem to belong. Everything I thought was mysterious or unclear about Dali's art just clears and comes to its place. The inner garden and the great room in the basement are, naturally, the most beautiful. The artworks there are fascinating, both because of their grandeur, as well as the manner they were created. But, the building itself is also magnificent, with narrow hallways and dark, mysterious rooms. The whole collection is beautifully arranged in this unusual space. To put it shortly - for any art lover, this museum should not be missed! And the important addition - it is CROWDED, so either come early (10 a.m. like we did and waited only 5 minutes in line) or pre-book the tickets. You'll need at least two hours to see everything, so take some water in summer months because it gets warm inside some smaller rooms.

He was a rude , odious , horrible individual who had no customer skills what so ever . In the ensuing 20 mins he would listen to no reason and continued demanding the €70 , which we eventually paid to get my bag back and gain an exit for my daughter in her wheelchair. Can not comment on the exhibition as we did not see it . A horrible, horrible experience in an overly crowded building , managed by a Basil Fawlty manager and made to pay €70 for the pleasure ......AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGE .","negative","negative",0,13

A lot of early work of this amazing artist, with only a few of his  famous  pieces.  Regardless, completely worth the trip. From Barcelona I took the train from Passieg de Gracia train station - no need to go to Sants. The trip was about 2 hours, but the high speed train (about 50 min.) is also available. The museum is then only about a 10 minute walk from the train station with signs guiding you all the way. It's my understanding the the high speed train drops you off at a different station further out of town.  I did not pre-book tickets for my Friday visit, but got there early enough to avoid any lines. The place gets a lot of visitors, so it can be difficult to really study a piece with so many people zipping by.

I'm sure that the museum's designers had a plan in the museum's layout; I just couldn't figure out any pattern; maybe that's the way Dali wanted it. The town itself is cute and easily walkable. There's an interesting assortment of shops, and there are plenty of good restaurants and cafes. On the Saturday we were there, there was no vehicular traffic on most of the streets in the center making a stroll around town a lot of fun. We took the AVE train from Barcelona Sants.

I'm sure that the museum's designers had a plan in the museum's layout; I just couldn't figure out any pattern; maybe that's the way Dali wanted it. The town itself is cute and easily walkable. There's an interesting assortment of shops, and there are plenty of good restaurants and cafes. On the Saturday we were there, there was no vehicular traffic on most of the streets in the center making a stroll around town a lot of fun. We took the AVE train from Barcelona Sants. This train takes 50 minutes instead of over 2 hours for the local train, but it stops at Figures Vilafont station, a very long walk from the museum. There's a bus every 20 minutes for &lt; 2 euros or a cab costs 11 euros. With the fast train, it's very doable to leave Barcelona at 10 AM and be back by 4 PM. The limiting factor is museum ticket availability. Buy museum tix online first, then the train tickets. RENFE's website is not very friendly. I couldn't get it to accept any US credit cards. For just a couple of dollars more, you can buy from Petrabax, RENFE's US online ticket agency. This is a  must see. ","positive","negative",7,25

Being able to see the wide range of his work made it clear that he wasn't just a surrealist but could create in any style that he chose. The train trip was easy to negotiate and the walk to the museum wasn't difficult. We combined a late morning visit to the museum with an overnight stay in Girona on the way back to Barcelona. It made for an excellent little trip and we were very happy that we took the extra time to see the amazing Dali museum. Highly recommended (at least off-season).","positive","positive",8,1

I live close to the Dali Museum in St Petersburg Florida and it is a work of art all by itself. Having been there many times I knew that his Mothership Museum in Figures was a - must do. This building houses an incredible collection of his works- from his early pieces to a separate building that has a collection of his custom jewelry pieces. I highly recommend a visit to this museum you will not be disappointed.","positive","neutral",3,3

We were astounded at how forward-thinking Dali was and had no idea of how much he has contributed to hte art world and the world in general. 3D paintings before 3D was even thought about and pictures that changed if you viewed them through a camera! We were gob-smacked at some of the thing Dali did in his lifetime. QWe also visited the Dali Jewellry Museum next door and had no idea he did this. Some of the pieces were fantastic and none of it could be worn as day-to-day jewellry. We were so impressed, we have invested in a Dali book to learn more about him.","positive","negative",2,5

I knew going in that a lot of his most famous pieces were in New York's MoMa (my home!), Madrid's Reina Sofia (visited days prior), Brussels, and other world-class museums. What this means for you is that you will see almost no melting clocks. His most familiar works will be missing.  What you get instead is a loveletter to his wife, Gala, who appears in many works. You see how he progressed as an artist; the fine lines of some of his surreal works and the chunkier smears of some of his more pedestrian landscapes. You will see a single telephone on a field of black. You will see a few paintings that are clearly mockeries of Picasso and other contemporaries. You will see a strange obsession with Velasquez. All this will give you insight into the artist himself.  I came away inspired and motivated and more informed than before. Occasionally, I laughed. If you're not really into Dali, you may not find a lot to justify the trip.","positive","positive",8,7

Second , there are many guides leading different groups and they seem to be competing for attention and they speak very loudly , so following one is quite natural and you get a lot of free explanations this way ! If you do not want to do this , pick the plan from the front office ,and follow it : it is quite clear but one has to follow the crowd as going against the flow could be quite bumpy ! For the smokers , there is a beautiful terrasse on the 3rd floor !

With the same ticket you can visit the Dali Jewels also, which are amazing. Everywhere you can take pictures, no flash. If you arrive by train from Barcelona (about 2 hours, trains many the whole day), on the way back you should stop for some hours in the city of Girona, an amazing architecture of coloured houses on the river banks, a beautiful cathedral and church on the hill.

If you decide to go on your own, I will recommend you to book tickets online before showing up. The queue can be quite long.","positive","negative",2,3

Figueres  is a quaint little town and Dali's Museum (Teatre Museu Dali) stands in stark contrast to anything in the vicinity, or maybe all of Spain! Brightly painted a deep umber/red color, the entire surface is dotted with little tan round bread-like sculpture rosettes and, lining the entire roof perimeter are huge, beige colored egg scluptures. We lost count of the number.    Eggs  play a major part in his art and it is attributed to his mother who passed away from uterine cancer when he was 16. The  egg  is also a tribute to his home in Catalunya. It is a commonly repeated theme, or element, in his art.  Come early, the theater/museum fills up quickly and it is a long drive to get here from Barcelona. The museum opens at 10:30 from October to June and, in July, it opens at 9 a.m. All backpacks and large items must be checked and the flash function on cameras must be turned off. Just so you know.  This abandoned theater was restored under Dali's direction and it is a work of art itself; it is more than a mere  installation  of his donated art. This is the most visited art museum in Spain. It is a happy place where his imagination ran wild and the museum invites the visitor to do the same with his own imagination.  A diver perched on top of the entry, invites the visitor to  dive in and expore one's own unconsciousness.   Gala was Dali's wife. She is a Russian woman 10 years his senior. He met her when he was 25. He married her twice, the last time in 1964 in a Catholic church. In his later days, he went from being anti-clerical to extremely pro-Catholic.  Gala continued to be his inspiration (she is frequently featured in much of his work), his artistic muse, his marketing director, banker, and she is the person who is credited with creating his  brand .  Dali's family did not accept Gala, or Dali's friends, or much of the way Dali lived his life.

Had good lunch at a nearby restaurant and walked around the town center for over an hour before leaving to our next destination. Highly recommend to family with kids young or teen.","positive","neutral",8,8

My partner isn't into art as much as I am but he enjoyed it nonetheless, it is however very strange, and if you are not into the surrealistic nature of the art you probably won't enjoy too much.  We went in an off season so it wasn't too busy but there was several school groups. The ticket you buy at the museum also covers the dali jewels exhibit which is also worth the time.","positive","negative",3,5

The installations, particularly the Mae West couch, are arranged so that there is constant flow of visitors taking a quick look and being moved on. There are one or two rooms with stunning works on the ceiling. The galleries and alcoves above the main lobby, which display any of his sketches, are a little quieter, and the staircase to the rear leads to a small treasure: Dali's private collection of work by other artists. In hindsight, this museum in Figueres is something of a disappointment. A couple of days later I toured Dali's house in Port Lligat, about an hour's drive away, and came away from there feeling like I had learned a lot more about Dali as an artist and a person. Make time to visit his house!","positive","negative",3,4

Outside it is visually stunning with golden statues on the building and sculptures in the surroundings, one looks like it is made out of tyres, and set into the building is the face of Dali with a tv and large egg behind a glass partition. The main courtyard is shaped like an amphitheatre with more golden statutes, a ship and a sculpture of a lady on a car whose interior features a lady and gentleman and driver covered with ivy and snails !. The top of the amphitheatre is edged with white sinks !!!!, Inside the building is a massive painting by Dali and another amazing work of art is a painting of Abraham Lincoln which is made up of lots of smaller paintings which viewed from a distance becomes a picture of a naked lady !. As well as Dali paintings there are sculptures, sketches and a room with whose furniture depicts the face of Mae West, a red sofa forming the lips and two large paintings forming the eyes. Another room one enters by the mouth in a three dimensional face, the hair being made out of cobs of sweetcorn and the nose is a model of upside down baby.

I absolutely loved the Dali Theatre Museum, it is like nothing I have ever seen before, from the outside it looks like a rose pink fortress topped with giant eggs, a glass dome and what looks like bread rolls on it's exterior !!! Outside it is visually stunning with golden statues on the building and sculptures in the surroundings, one looks like it is made out of tyres, and set into the building is the face of Dali with a tv and large egg behind a glass partition. The main courtyard is shaped like an amphitheatre with more golden statutes, a ship and a sculpture of a lady on a car whose interior features a lady and gentleman and driver covered with ivy and snails !. The top of the amphitheatre is edged with white sinks !!!!, Inside the building is a massive painting by Dali and another amazing work of art is a painting of Abraham Lincoln which is made up of lots of smaller paintings which viewed from a distance becomes a picture of a naked lady !. As well as Dali paintings there are sculptures, sketches and a room with whose furniture depicts the face of Mae West, a red sofa forming the lips and two large paintings forming the eyes. Another room one enters by the mouth in a three dimensional face, the hair being made out of cobs of sweetcorn and the nose is a model of upside down baby. Also there is a beautiful bed, the bottom is made up of two sea serpents for the legs. Salvador Dali is buried in the basement.  The Dali Theatre-Museum is a totally surreal place and it makes any visit a wonderful, fun and informative visitor experience.  Visited October 2011","positive","negative",5,6

Dali's works are so complex and with so much meaning that you need clues to figure it out. Don't miss the jewelry room with the ruby hearth--it moves!",140,"Worth a visit!.

Some genius pieces there indeed, with some hands on interaction although probably not a place you would take your kids. Dali was one sexual being and this is very evident in his art. I guarantee you won't be bored here, it's definitely an eye-opener ;)",140,"Dali was one cryptic character. Definitely worth a visit if only to experience some of his work.

Taking the regional train it's about 1:45 ride on the MD line (less stops) and a 10 minute walk from the Figueres station. Lovely walk through this quiet town. The Dali Museum is built in an old theater and much larger than I imagined. There are so many interesting works of art to see, please make sure that you allow yourself at the very least 2 hours (or more) to enjoy all of the differnet exhibits. Whether or not you appreciate modern art I'm sure you will walk away feeling admiration for his mad genius.<br><br>As a side note, leave some time to stop and visit the beautiful little town of Girona on the train ride back to Barcelona. A late lunch in this gem of a city made our full day trip complete!",140,"Great Day Trip From Barcelona. We decided to do this as a day trip during a four day stay in Barcelona and so glad we did.
