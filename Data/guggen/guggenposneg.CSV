It is not signposted from the motorways, only local signs once you are nearby. Fortunately, the satnav triumphed. We were directed up many marble steps to the main entrance, only to have to descend a similar number to the entrance foyer. We paid €7.50 each for concessions which surprised us. We were struck by the absence of directions on the walls. We had to rely on a small print booklet and a hand held earphone - both free. The booklet needed time to read and descriptive colourfull diagrams and a recommended journey through the museum were not easily found. There are three floors, but the second was vacant. On the first, or ground floor was a small exhibition area whith no signs as to the contents, so we went to the third floor in a glass lift because the booklet said that it contained impressionist paintings. Again, poorly signed, we ended up along a dead end corridor, which only lead to the toilets. There were pictures by Toulouse Lautrec, but many were advertising posters and well spaced apart. Our booklet did tell us that if we entered the number of a picture as shown on an adjacent wall card alongside a headphone icon, our earphone would give us full details concerning the picture. But only about 10% of the pictures had corresponding icons or numbers, and this disappointed.

My suggestions is to walk around the building and admire its fantastic architecture and design. The building is what is truly a great piece of art.

It is one of those buildings that looks better ""in the flesh"" than it does on TV and in magazines<br>Then I made the mistake of paying €10 to go inside.<br>I won't comment on the art itself as it's clearly subjective (although the Francis Bacon exhibition was definitely the highlight) however I was struck by the fact that there was little or no innovation in how it was presented and very few opportunities for visitors to interact in any way with what was on show.<br>What really amazed me though was the attitude of the staff, especially those placed at the exhibitions.

Rarely review attractions but felt compelled to on this occasion after a visit to the Guggenheim.  Firstly, it looks absolutely fantastic from the outside - an amazing piece of architecture and worth visiting the city just to see it there in front of you. It is one of those buildings that looks better  in the flesh  than it does on TV and in magazines Then I made the mistake of paying €10 to go inside. I won't comment on the art itself as it's clearly subjective (although the Francis Bacon exhibition was definitely the highlight) however I was struck by the fact that there was little or no innovation in how it was presented and very few opportunities for visitors to interact in any way with what was on show. What really amazed me though was the attitude of the staff, especially those placed at the exhibitions.

"rn388606541","Valdereedee","Athens","Iconic and brilliant",5,"2016-07-03","The visual treat of visiting the Guggenheim begins as you approach it along the riverfront and the curved metal structure sweeps into view. Even if you didn't venture inside, you'd be left with a sense of awe and wonder at the brilliant imagination of the architect Frank Gehry. The strange giant spider-like metal sculpture by French-American artist Louise Bourgeois outside the back of the building builds a sense of anticipation of the wonders that are inside. Walking round to the front you'll see the towering giant 'flower puppy' created by Jeff Koon which sits outside, setting the tone for several hours of pleasure absorbing a rich array of eclectic works displayed over several floors. If you added up the numbers of works displayed, it would likely not be extensive but this is place is about clever and contemplative curation and choosing extraordinary pieces and placing them perfectly within the undulating structure of the museum. Some of the pieces are so immense it is hard to imagine them working as well in other museums - the Guggenheim has the impressive dimensions and sweep to show magnificent, huge, ambitious and bold work in a way that plays beautifully to the strengths of this unique building as well as to the imagination of the artists and sculptors whose work is shown there. A video art installation by a Finnish artist shown across three giant screens was completely absorbing as the audience is dwarfed by the story that literally surrounds them, with fragments of the story tripping across the screens from one side to the other, with the artist herself gently smiling from a screen on one side of the room while watching the actors in her film 'rehearse' on a screen on the other side. Some of the cavernous spaces are devoted to housing just a few creations which are given generous space for maximum impact - it works brilliantly with the works of Cy Twombly, Anselm Kiefer and Robert Rauschenberg, all shown to great effect, stopping visitors in their tracks and encouraging them to drink in the story behind the art. The audio guides provided are excellent too as they convey fascinating snippets about the lives of the artists, their working methods and the inspiration behind their work.

The building is awesome, what is outside is awesome, and what is inside is awesome. There may be some exhibits that you don't get or aren't for you, just bypass it as there is so much to see. 16 € per adult entrance which includes guide and audio. Public clean toilets.

If you are walking along the riverside you are greeted by a giant glass and metalwork spider. If you approach from tram or roadside, you are met by a 3 storey high Scottish terrier, made from flowers and various forna that is constantly changing colour with the seasons. The museum itself is breath taking and I will not spoil it for you, but do allow yourself plenty of time to visit and be amazed at some of the exhibits, at least 2-3 hours.","positive","negative",3,4

So it's a bit like the emperors clothes, because Warhol supported him non of the art critics will say what they really think. One actually called Basquiat a genius lol. But anyway a great place to visit and check it out for yourself.","positive","negative",4,9

It was interesting with the use of video and music to present the life of this artist. If you are staying in Bilbao, it probably is a lot more convenient to visit than from San Sebastián.","positive","neutral",2,2

As this change regularly I would not let that put me off returning. What should be changed though is the role of the photo police. In certain rooms you are allowed to use your camera. However the photographer has to stand on a designated sticker whilst anyone being photographed must be on another. Members of staff are standing around to make sure this is complied with and rush to speak to any one who attempts to get their camera out in a different spot. To be frank this is disturbing and ruins the atmosphere. It also caused considerable confusion to those who spoke neither Spanish or English It would be better to have a blanket ban of photography. It is important to remember that like most museums,galleries etc in Spain it is closed on Mondays except during the Summer peak periods and depending on what is actually on you may be better saving your money and just look at the exterior of the building and what you can see of the interior before you reach the cash desks.","positive","negative",2,11

It is even more stunning than in the pictures. For someone who is not educated in architecture, but definitely admires and apreciates it, I must say that this building was one of the most impressive I've ever seen. It is especially curious how its metallic outer area changes its colour depending on the period of the day, or even due to the meteorological aspects. Jeff Koon's works only add to the overall impression, especially the Puppy, which I considered to be kitchy before, but after seeing it live, I absolutely changed my opinion. The inner space reflects the complexity and variety of the architectural solutions, with an incredible natural lightning. Only the building itself is almost enough of a reason to visit his museum. Modern art lovers willl also find some famous and really impressive works. I was especially impressed by Richard Serra's ""Matter of Time"" and Jenny Holzer's installation.

The conversation created by the materials and methods of each artist is a fun one to have.   Richard Serra's exhibit on the first floor is a must see, you should walk through all of the pieces because it will play with your emotions through physical spaces. When I went, Jeff Koons and Jean-Michel Basquiat were the featured artists. I loved Jeff Koons beforehand, and so I was excited to see the gallery, which is quite large and has some of the most playfully creative art I have seen. The Basquiat exhibit (which I did not know anything about) gave me an interest in the life he lived, and a curiosity about the methods he used to convey his thoughts. Overall, a very interesting museum.","positive","positive",10,3

The giant spider, called maman, is 9 metres tall and is highly contradictory as emblems of maternity, it suggests both as protector and as predator. Unfortunately no one was allowed to take photos inside of the museum, except for a few things. It really bummed me out since I saw many interesting things at the exhibition of Yoko Ono.

Accross the river, then into the main high street and turned right to arrive at this building after 10-15 minutes walk. The little 'dog' in front of the building made it more pleasing to the overall setting. Outdoor cafe and you can also sit inside and the free wifi is available, which all are supplementary to the great building and its collection of modern art.

We travelled around the area of Bilbao by narrow gauge train or tube railway - you can go out in the hills or down to the sea. The Transporter Bridge**** in the estuary is well worth seeing - there are few of these left (others at Middlesbrough, England and Newport, Wales) to photograph it in action, the best views are from the nearby little ferry-boat. Plenty to see in the three days we were there. Recommended.","positive","positive",6,5

One is at once thrilled and overwhelmed by the magnificence and surprise of both the interior and exterior spaces from the colossal entry steps to the breathtaking atrium of the entrance to the museum. This is a structure that surprises and delights at every turn, at every angle, looking up through the interior spaces to the sky, or following the curved lines of the glass elevators or merging the outside spaces with the interior spaces as one walks about. This is a building that must be visited, must be seen to be believed. Personally, I don’t think I have ever seen a building this wonderful and moving and unique. If you can make it to Bilbao do so if only to partake of one of, if not the, greatest works of modern architecture. As the luck of the draw would have it, none of the 11 works by Anselm Kiefer were on display; to me that was a real disappointment.

Taught us that art doesn't have to be solemn and unattainable. We experienced the work of Richard Serra (permanent collection), Ernesto Neto and Yoko Ono (that Yoko Ono) and it was fun. As for the building, only seen in site. Was conceived by a madman, the engineers must have been crazy and who paid was insane. Long live the madness!","positive","negative",3,6

This time I feel we truely appreciated and absorbed the beauty of the architecture and understood more about how the architecture was conceived and the relationship of the structure to Bilbao. Part of the building was closed off while new exhibits were being constructed, but that did not distract from enjoying and experiencing this fabulous attraction. Some of the art exhibits are a bit difficult to get your head around, but one can appreciate the thought and creativity each artist invested in the works displayed. The current exhibit entitled  The Clock  was particularly facinating. The concept behind the exhibit and the collection of thousands of film and television clips comprising this exhibit are beyond comprehension. My wife and I spent nearly two hours enjoying this exhibit. Bilbao can be proud to have the Guggenheim as an integral part of the community. Anyone visiting Bilbao should not miss this attraction.","positive","negative",4,5

I took my 87yr old mum who doesn't like art galleries, together with my 18yr old son who is interested in architecture and we all really enjoyed it. It was a dull mid September day but what a fantastic visit! I was truly surprised how much I loved it. It was a good idea to pre-book online (individual gallery headsets were very helpful for the building, rather than the art -which was not great to me).We spent all day there! We walked in the exhibition off the atrium, got a feel for the place and then got writstbands to return after we'd relaxed with coffees outside (superb service). We also had a fantastic 3 course lunch menu that was excellent value (including wine) in the cafe/restaurant, with great river views. We returned, as it looked different when the sun moved and so we went around the complex passages again. There is a glass fishshaped lift if you cannot walk, but you would miss so many beautiful nooks and crannies, some with seating. It was even open in the evening.

I took my 87yr old mum who doesn't like art galleries, together with my 18yr old son who is interested in architecture and we all really enjoyed it. It was a dull mid September day but what a fantastic visit! I was truly surprised how much I loved it. It was a good idea to pre-book online (individual gallery headsets were very helpful for the building, rather than the art -which was not great to me).We spent all day there! We walked in the exhibition off the atrium, got a feel for the place and then got writstbands to return after we'd relaxed with coffees outside (superb service). We also had a fantastic 3 course lunch menu that was excellent value (including wine) in the cafe/restaurant, with great river views. We returned, as it looked different when the sun moved and so we went around the complex passages again. There is a glass fishshaped lift if you cannot walk, but you would miss so many beautiful nooks and crannies, some with seating. It was even open in the evening.

The audio guide was ok but gosh they saw things in the exhibits that we did not!!!!! Enjoyed the puppy, tulips and Anish Kapoor's ball structure. Enjoyed the Andy Warhol piece and the Gilbert and George but failed to recognise many of the other artists and as for the two irregular pieces of metal leaning on a wall!!!!! Having said all that we were in there over three hours and so must have enjoyed the visit!!!!","positive","negative",2,8

The most striking artwork was Richard Serra's  The Matter of Time , made up of huge rusted steel sheets curved into shapes that you wander around, between and into the centre of. A 'must see' attraction, even for those with no interest in art.","positive","negative",1,3

There were a few exhibitions on at the time which although very odd in my opinion were interesting enough. There were audio guides in English and you could get a guided tour if you wished.

The appetizer was good but the main course was very bad. Two fishes were not cooked, by me and my husband the fish was overcooked, tough and with a horrible sauce. Normally we take a dessert but we didn't want to take the risk of another disappointment. Quality-price is very bad! We have already been in several expensive restaurants but never eaten so bad.
