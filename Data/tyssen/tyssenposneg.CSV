The museum is very well organized by the period of the art. The Thyssen collection has lot of American artists and great collection of abstractionists. We spent about 3 hours there. Like most museums, lighting is a problem to take non flash pictures. But, careful positioning can help. Around the corner is the Prado and a great fresh salad restaurant. That's for another review.

It's also the best (only?) place in Madrid to see Impressionist paintings and 19C American landscapes. Thyssen-Bornemisza's wife Carmen became a collector in her own right and the sections in the museum bearing her name (the rooms designated by letters rather than numbers) also astonish. Unlike the Prado, where you can luxuriate in seeing scores of paintings by Goya, for instance, at the Thyssen you get a thorough excursion through the history of Western art with just a specimen or two from many great painters, famous and not.

Thyssen-Bornemisza's wife Carmen became a collector in her own right and the sections in the museum bearing her name (the rooms designated by letters rather than numbers) also astonish. Unlike the Prado, where you can luxuriate in seeing scores of paintings by Goya, for instance, at the Thyssen you get a thorough excursion through the history of Western art with just a specimen or two from many great painters, famous and not. The temporary exhibit of contemporary Spanish realism that was on while we were there was also quite interesting --and fun to compare those still lifes to those by Zurbarán upstairs, painted some four centuries earlier. Plan for plenty of time here. You can take a break in the nice ground-floor restaurant.","positive","positive",6,4

Considering that it was essentially a private collection---the 2 Barons Thyssen-Bornemisza, and Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza---the number and variety of paintings is nothing short of amazing.

The museum is well laid-out; it's not a palatial space like the Prado, it's ample but feels intimate. A highlight during 4 days in Madrid, i enjoyed it as much as or more than the Prado. Great audio guide in English, too. Photos permitted.","positive","positive",4,2

It has a particularly good collection of Dutch and Flemish painting, including Breughel, Van Eyck, Van Ruysdael, Steen and even one Vermeer. I was also surprised how many American paintings it had, including Gilbert Stuart's portrait of George Washington's cook! There were some Peales and Copleys, quite a few Bierstadt landscapes, Russel (who in this collection I saw as an impressionist rather than just a Western painter). There was even a painting by George Catlin of the Falls of St. Anthony as they existed before the founding of my home city, Minneapolis, Minnesota!  The collection also does a good job of including the 19th and 20th century. It includes works by many of the famous artists that are rather different than what we are used to. One gem is Picasso's painting of the Harlequin. Or there is also a relatively realistic engraving by Van Gogh.   The museum fills three floors of galleries and it is a lot but we had a good look in about 2 1/2 hours. Admission is €10.","positive","positive",8,6

You'll get a feel of the museum, enjoy a smaller sample of art and maybe have coffee at the beautiful garden café.  Students, teachers and over 65: bring ID (mandatory) for discounts.

The gallery is light &amp; airy &amp; provides plenty of benches. I found the English language plan &amp; guide informative &amp; easy to follow. On the ground floor there is the temporary exhibition space which at the time of my visit had a Cezanne exhibition which was predictably crowded, as opposed to the regular exhibition.  The restaurant was excellent, clean, well organised table service, good selection - far superior to either The Prado or Reina Sofia. The icing on the cake? €7 entrance for over 65 !!","positive","positive",7,1

Wow- I would have been so sad if I had missed the Thyssen. The galleries are wide and there are lots of benches to sit and observe the art. The crowds were very light when we visited late in the day. The variety of paintings is fabulous. Flemish masters to modern art. Beautiful American landscapes which I was so surprised to see in a Spanish museum. A Pisarro Exhibition was going on when we visited which was worthwhile to see. I would rank this up there with the Musee DÓrsay.

Enjoy!   p.s.: if front of The Art doesn't matter how much are you going to spend, but remember that the ticket of this exhibition is really really cheap and if you want there are also some days free: have a look!","positive","negative",2,3

Definitely a museum that needs to be visited while in Madrid. And it is conveniently located on the Paseo del Prado, right across the street from the famous Museo del Prado.","positive","neutral",3,3

The audio guide is very informative, and there are rare canvases, like Gainsborough’s portrait. On the whole, the gallery houses plenty of masterpieces by XX century painters: Braque, Picasso, Kandinsky, and a beautiful collection of impressionists and postimpressionism, Pissaro, Degas, Edouard Manet (don’t miss his Woman in Riding Habit!), Claude Monet , Toulouse-Lautrec, Cezanne among them. So, if you love painting, take your time!","positive","negative",3,4
