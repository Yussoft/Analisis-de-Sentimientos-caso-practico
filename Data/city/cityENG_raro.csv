After all isn't this the one thing that revitalised the whole city? First impression did not disappoint. The vistas are magnificent with the opera house looking like an albino orca leaping out of the sea, although the palm trees on the higher level looked a bit out of place. On approaching the building itself though we found it very unwelcoming. There is no entrance at all where we thought there might be, only a nondescript white door leading to a nondescript box office. There is no access to the public area unless you book a guided tour. There looks like a restaurant at the wider end by the water but our experience just put us off trying to find out. That's the overall feel of the entire complex - you have to walk great distances from one building to another to find there's no payoff at the end of it. Likewise the hemisphere, you can only enter into the totally drab lower level to the cafe or get a ticket to see an imax film you could see anywhere in the world. The science museum seems totally geared towards attracting children which put us off paying the 8 euros to get in, and the entrances are only at each end hundreds of metres apart. The building itself is looking a bit run down too. The agora looked tall and impressive until you get there and find the doors are barely kept closed with chains and padlocks. Seems like the management is missing a trick which reminded me of the south bank centre in the seventies. There's just nothing going on during the day and it's totally sterile. Compare that with South Bank Centre now which is bustling with life day and night since they open their doors not just for the events and throw everyone out afterwards. The cafes inside and behind the museum were completely empty since most people probably just go in the building to use the loos. We didn't even bother getting to the aquarium after that, never mind the 30€ it costs to get in. The place looks futuristic for now but nothing dates faster than vision of the future. I hope they bring some life to the complex before it turns into a white elephant. We went back to the old town afterwards and found there were loads of hidden museums that are free to visit.

It is an absolutely amazing construction that stirs up your imagination. Just walking around the different buildings is well worth visiting and there's surely something going on in the street to see as well. Plan at least one and a half hours if you just go for a walk. This is free.<br>However, if you want to see the different shows, you need two days minimum. <br><br>1.-The oceanarium needs 3 hours if you go fast and don't take the audioguide. You'll see sharks, walrus, dolphins, sea lions and exotic fish...If this is the first oceanarium you'll see, you'll have a great time...But in my case, after seeing the one in Lisbon and in Chicago as well as other smaller ones, I wasn't really that surprised.<br>All in all, I enjoyed myself a lot and this was the building I recommend the most if you need to choose.<br><br>2.- The Principe Felipe Museum needs more than 3 hours. I spent 2 and a half and I could only see one floor and in a rush. It has interactive exhibitions that make the experience very amusing. I was fascinated by the Tesla exhibition and I liked the dinosaurs and the DNA show, too.<br><br>3.- The Hemispheric is not worth visiting at all, in my opinion.

I've visited this location twice and definitely what I like the most is the architecture and the exterior look. It is an absolutely amazing construction that stirs up your imagination. Just walking around the different buildings is well worth visiting and there's surely something going on in the street to see as well. Plan at least one and a half hours if you just go for a walk. This is free.<br>However, if you want to see the different shows, you need two days minimum. <br><br>1.-The oceanarium needs 3 hours if you go fast and don't take the audioguide. You'll see sharks, walrus, dolphins, sea lions and exotic fish...If this is the first oceanarium you'll see, you'll have a great time...But in my case, after seeing the one in Lisbon and in Chicago as well as other smaller ones, I wasn't really that surprised.<br>All in all, I enjoyed myself a lot and this was the building I recommend the most if you need to choose.<br><br>2.- The Principe Felipe Museum needs more than 3 hours. I spent 2 and a half and I could only see one floor and in a rush. It has interactive exhibitions that make the experience very amusing. I was fascinated by the Tesla exhibition and I liked the dinosaurs and the DNA show, too.<br><br>3.- The Hemispheric is not worth visiting at all, in my opinion.

Kids are running around, banging on the exhibits, even intentionally pushing aside other visitors without parents (or employees?!) saying a word. I understand it's not the employee's job to parent the kids, but it should be their job to prevent the little brats from ruining the visit for the rest of us. I'll give you an example: there are a couple of incubators where you can observe baby chickens being hatched.

There is also a disco that opens at 1 am that we did not visit but was still very lively at 4 am on our way to the airport. I will spend more time there next visit."

To visit el Museu de les Ciències Príncipe Felipe takes few hours at least, and it was interactive and involving, fun for both children and adults. L'Oceanogràfic is a whole day experience and definitely worth a visit. I did not enter the rest but even just sitting and drinking a surprisingly inexpensive glass of white wine in front of the El Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia with great music from a restaurant as a soundtrack, made me feel like I was in some sort of a futuristic movie.<br>It is a site not to be missed and as I look at the hundreds of photos I took i realized that I will definitely go back there, sooner or later!"

The Tour bus stops there so you can pick it up anytime to get back."

The staff service was mediocre to poor on average (the low end of which was the attendant of the electricity ""show"", who bluntly turned away half of the people who had queued up for the next show complaining that they should get the tickets for entry at the ticket office and better read the printed prerequisites posted among a long and small printed poster by the entry door). With a pointless policy like that they had better inform visitors about this when you purchase the tickets at the entry and post it clearly.<br><br>The oceanographic pavilion was better and is the only reason for not rating the experience poor. It is more diverse and the dolphin show was very well managed, although the first 15 min of the show was spent selecting 'volunteers' among the kids in the audience, which was about 10 minutes too long. I don't care for zoo's and this marine zoo is no exception, many of the species show obvious signs of stress and trauma from being locked in what is a very real prison."

We spent over three hours and the only building we entered was the Hemisferic to see the IMAX movie. The movie was OK; wouldn’t highly recommend it as the best IMAX we’ve ever seen. But the Arts and Sciences complex was outstanding. We are familiar with Calatrava’s work in the United States and therefore were very interested in seeing his structures in his hometown of Valencia. Work was being done on the Opera Building and it was almost completely covered in scaffolding so we couldn’t enjoy that…and the large reflecting pool on the back side of the Hemisferic was empty as it was being cleaned. But neither impacted our overall experience. The complex is such an interesting contrast to the old, historic city center; we enjoyed both.

The name translates to the City of Arts and Sciences which sounds a bit formal and off putting. It isn't. I travelled there by city bus and could see the very distinctive shapes of the structures from a couple of bus stops away. I had to restrain myself and wait until the bus stopped in front of the Ocranographic at the far end of the complex. As its name implies, the Oceanographic is a huge Aquarium and also an underwater city incorporating the seven seas and all their inhabitants. There's also a cool gift shop. I especially enjoyed visiting the Agora, a huge open market place featuring an exhibit of the construction of the Ciudad. The space is large enough to hold more than one tennis court and it has indeed hosted a major tennis tournament. Walking across the Calatrava bridge took me back to Buenos Aires and his awesome Puenta de la Mujer. I stopped for a drink at the magnificent Opera House, formally named Palau de las Artes Reina Sofia (Queen Sofia's Palace of Arts) and enjoyed the cool breeze coming off the fountains lining the walkway to Prince Philip's Science Museum where kids of all ages are positively encouraged to become involved with all aspects of the scientific experience. Then there's the Umbracle, a weirdly named but architecturally fascinating narrow exhibition space that cleverly conceals the parking area. There's too much more to describe here. Each structure, on its own, would be an architectural masterpiece. There are at least 6 phenomenal buildings, each distinct from the others but each bearing Calatrava's distinctive style. Not to be missed. Kids will love it. Adults will marvel at different aspects. It would be an awesome adventure for 3 generations. It's possible to walk through the entire City, the Agora and Umbracle for free; the museums and Oceanografic have entrance fees. Best to purchase a ticket combining several attractions.

As an architectural photography aficionado, I was not disappointed, and the beauty of the architectural concept of the entire space is fantastic. This is a site not to be missed, if this is what you seek. The events and attractions at The City were pretty good, but in the interest of full disclosure, I live and entertain myself in Southern California, and as such, have a huge variety of world class entertainment venues at my disposal, and the aquatic, scientific, and IMAX events available at home are hard to compete with. Nevertheless, I did attend the IMAX Hidden Universe showing and found it very interesting and entertaining, though the technical audio equipment is about a decade or so behind the IMAX equipment in California. This made it less impressive for me personally, but it was still quite adequate. The Science Museum is in need of a complete makeover- the displays were not impressive, and were mainly of high school or elementary school educational display quality. The reduced scale model of the European Space Agency's portions of the International Space Agency was my highlight, and that might not be enough to impress the average traveler. The Oceanografic was to be the high point of our visit- however, as I said before, California has Sea World in Mission Bay near San Diego, and it is difficult to compete on that scale.

My visit to The City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia, Spain, was mainly to see firsthand the architectural work of Santiago Calatrava. As an architectural photography aficionado, I was not disappointed, and the beauty of the architectural concept of the entire space is fantastic. This is a site not to be missed, if this is what you seek. The events and attractions at The City were pretty good, but in the interest of full disclosure, I live and entertain myself in Southern California, and as such, have a huge variety of world class entertainment venues at my disposal, and the aquatic, scientific, and IMAX events available at home are hard to compete with. Nevertheless, I did attend the IMAX Hidden Universe showing and found it very interesting and entertaining, though the technical audio equipment is about a decade or so behind the IMAX equipment in California. This made it less impressive for me personally, but it was still quite adequate. The Science Museum is in need of a complete makeover- the displays were not impressive, and were mainly of high school or elementary school educational display quality. The reduced scale model of the European Space Agency's portions of the International Space Agency was my highlight, and that might not be enough to impress the average traveler. The Oceanografic was to be the high point of our visit- however, as I said before, California has Sea World in Mission Bay near San Diego, and it is difficult to compete on that scale.

Firstly like other reviews say- it's worth the visit to see the buildings even if you don't go inside. We went to the museum, oceanographic aquarium and the cinema hemispheric and they were all great. Long day however, yes you will need the whole day to do all three but you can space it over 2 or 3 days I believe. If I were to pick one over the other though I would first choose to do aquarium (the dolphin show was cool!) then second hemispheric ( look at movie times and make sure you are early and get your ticket changed if you have a multi pass ticket - you can only see one movie under this) lastly the museum - there is a lot to see- very cool though- different to other museums!",145,"Cool architecture, great museums.

The 8 euro entrance fee you pay will only get you into about half of the exhibitions, and of the exhibitions you do get to see, half will be out of order. One entire floor is just a museum of famous Spanish scientists with barely any English translation of the texts. Most exhibits seem to be aimed at children or are just poorly thought out. Extremely disappointing day out, would not recommend. Better to admire the building from the outside!"

Maybe the effect is also due to its location in the dried river bed of the Turia – the magical sunken garden of Valencia that makes the city one of the most beautiful we’ve traveled to.<br><br>We were perhaps a bit disappointed to discover that the beautiful blue shell-shaped building between the Science Museum and the Aquarium complex was conceived as a public gathering place but not as a permanently open building as its name Ágora indicates. Upon a return trip to Valencia, we’ll definitely check the calendar for the next concert or sporting event at the Ágora if only to be able to go inside.<br><br>Even the garage isn’t simply a place to park your car inside but has a tree-lined avenue for pedestrians on top with open air art gallery, the necessary air shafts disguised as plump friendly alien figures in blue-tiled mosaic outfits. <br><br>We spent a wonderful day at the Oceanogràfic, saw a movie at the Hemisfèric, and marveled at the exhibits at the Science Musuem, and upon a return trip we’ll be revisiting all these attractions as well as getting tickets for a concert or opera at the Palau des les Arts.<br><br>After our return home we began to read up about the controversies surrounding the immense costs of the complex and about the rampant corruption within the Valencian provincial government. We can understand the rage some feel at the huge expenditures in light of cutbacks in all areas now but hope that in the long run this unique ensemble will prove to have been a wise investment in making Valencia very special indeed."

Also in this section is the Agora event centre, easily the worst maintained of the buildings. The Agora is only five years old but looks a little rough around the edges already.<br><br>The final piece of the City is the aquarium, a fine and ambitious aquatic zoo though not quite offering the majesty of the other external features.<br><br>These great and clearly expensive buildings exist in a country struggling to repay its debts. They are artistic masterpieces but inside it is not so great. The internal presentation is only good and does not match what is on the outside. For the traveller experiencing something like this for the first time the internal is much less of an issue but it does speak to the priorities accorded to style over substance.<br><br>The City of Arts and Sciences is probably Valencia's most well-known tourist attraction. It is worth a visit for sure as the structural visages are simply incredible."

If architecture is your thing then Valencia is well worth a visit. Being a pretty level city the bicycle is a great way to get around and these can be picked up and dropped off at dozens of different locations around the city..probably every couple of hundred yards. You can buy a card for about €20 and use these bikes as you wish.Pick up and drop off great. More and more cities are now making these available. The Zoo in Valencia is another good day out and also last but by no means least Valencia has a great port area and beach...If your lucky your visit may even coincide with the formula 1 race in late June."

I'm going to review each separately on Trip Advisor but it's worth mentioning here that you can get tickets for each individual attraction, or for two, or for all three. We did the latter. If you do the same, be aware that when you buy the ticket, you will need to decide which of the films being shown at the Hemisferico you want to see, so this ties you down to being there at a specific time. We underestimated how much time we would spend in the Oceanografico, so didn't make the film showing! It's worth noting as well that, so far as I can remember, the joint ticket covered us for one admission to each attraction, but we could have used the ticket for the science museum on the following day instead of cramming this into one day, as we did.
