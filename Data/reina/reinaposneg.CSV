The museum often has special exhibits going on. As an American I was highly pleased on one such occasion to see a special exhibit of mobiles by the famous American mobilist Alexander Calder. There were more mobiles than I had ever seen before or since and were displayed quite well except for the fact that there was so little air movement in the museum that the mobiles (which are designed to move) were immobile. So, whenever the security guards were not looking I would blow as hard as I could on the mobiles hanging overhead to see them in motion (as they were designed to be seen).   Check the times and dates of entry as the museum is typically closed on Tuesday. Be sure to check opening times for Sunday and Holidays.","positive","negative",6,7

The upper floors had a lot of very strange exhibits. I'm sure someone who appreciates this art style more would love it, but I thought it was rather pedestrian or odd for the sake of being different.  We thought it would be good to start at the top and work our way down, but after we reached floor 2, we regretted wasting our time at some of the other exhibits instead of going straight to main attractions.

At one point I was looking at a transparent hosepipe with running water taking up most of one room. Why?  Should have followed instinct and queued at the Prado - there was a reason that there was no queue and at 8 each is not good value. Wait until it is free (6.00, I think?)  Maybe I just don't get it, but in my opinion a waste of time and money.","negative","negative",0,7

There is so much to do in Madrid that unless you have unlimited time, take a quick lap through some of the less familiar territory.","positive","positive",3,2

The world rushes to see Picasso's Guernica, an important painting without doubt, but one I saw more than one hundred times at MOMA having grown up in New York. Special to me were the many wonderful early Dali, so many paintings of Miro and Tapies, a Catalan painter not seen much in the US, early films by the Lumiere brothers, photos by Man Ray, Un Chien en Andalou by Bunuel (with Dali), sculptures by Louise Bourgeous, one very interesting multi-media sculpture by Eudald Serra, a Catalan artist new to me. In addition, there is a small group of US works with some fine Motherwells and a beautiful Rothko in a surprising palette. It's a very spacious building with a large sculpture garden featuring some muscular works of Miro and a large Calder. I'm sure I'm leaving much out so go and complete the list.

We purchased ours online and truly beat the line, which at times makes the wait too long, and saved a bundle. Purchasing online for all Madrid attractions was very fast, safe, and cost a los less. From the collection we enjoyed viewing all the Picasso's and others, but nothing like the his Guernica collection and the painting itself. Allow time for coffee and churros in some of the many quaint restaurants and coffee shops in the sorrounding plaza. Access from Gran Via and other Madrid locations is excellent.

Half of it is ultra modern by the cafe and the other half has a colonial charm with a large courtyard in the center. The 2nd floor collection is by far the most impressive and took up most of our time spent here. There is a lot of surrealist artwork notably Dali and Man Ray. Interestingly the collection is organized by theme and time period (not by artist like the Prado) so there are Dali and Picasso works sprinkled about the museum. Obviously Guernica is the show stopper and worth the 8 Euro alone to see it. You can't take pictures in that wing of the museum but the rest of the museum is up for grabs so long as you don't use your flash. Another highlight is an awesome sculpture on the 3rd floor of the new modern building easily overlooked but clearly depicted on the map. It is an impressive statue of a cow, pig and lamb all as unicorns with marking indicating butcher cuts. There are also great views of the city from up here. Overall we spent about 3 hours there and saw everything we wanted to see. Admittedly our feet were still sore from 8 hours at the Prado the day before so if we had been fresher we might have spent another 30-60 minutes to catch it all.

Unless you like abstract modern art, for example, tiles and pieces or wood on the floor, give level 3 a miss.  It is definitely worth seeing as it represents different styles of art compared to the other Madrid museums.   Visit on Sundays as it is free (normally 8E).","positive","positive",7,6

I would also appreciate some more educational materials in the galleries themselves, rather than using my smartphone to teach myself (didn't have that option anyway).","positive","negative",1,6

Gear up for this one...its worth it and the building is beautiful.  PS: Sunday's after 1:30pm there are free tickets!!!","positive","positive",4,2

If your time in Madrid is limited, you can cover both Sofia and the Thyssen easily in one day - they are a short walk from each other, with the Sofia near the Atocha Renfe station.","positive","negative",1,4

An exhibition of the paintings by the famous painter, Dali, was ongoing during our visit which was the high point of our visit as was the famous modern art painting Guernica (made in 1937) by the famous painter, Pablo Picasso,  Definitely worth a visit while in madrid to complete the visits to the famous trio of art museums viz. Prado, Thyssen &amp; Reina Sofia.","positive","negative",1,5

I'm not Spanish, way too young to know anything of the Spanish civil war and nazis but what I've been lectured on and read myself, but this painting sucked the air out of me. It is the most incredible work of art I've ever seen in my life, without a doubt. Everyone in the world should be required to shuffle through that room and see that painting.  On the downside, the room is very crowded, and there are tons of people there to see it, many of them idiotic kids and teenagers with no appreciation of the work. Go early or stay late if you want to have better time with the painting.  And the rest of the museum? Tons of very interesting work, all kinds of great stuff to look at and study. The second floor is particularly good for the dada work, with a lot of Dali and others, including a video of Anadalusian Dog running. Good stuff. Lots of rooms with movies and videos going, all of it interesting. Lots of very dark, very unsettling work on the Spanish civil war--man.  The layout of the museum is pretty good, in that if you are trying to move in a specific direction and not get lost or run into deadends or keep seeing the same room over and over, you can do that.  I didn't even get to finish the museum, so have to go back and close it out someday. Can't wait.  Backpacks are not allowed, and there are self-serve lockers for 1 euro. Photos are allowed, but no flash. There are lots of restrooms throughout the museum.","positive","negative",9,12

I watched as one poor Spanish tourist was hassled from a room because he was ""holding his camera like he was going to take a photo"" - the camera wasn't even switched on. Shame, because the artwork is good (and I'm not really a modern art fan).

I had expected the Picassos (Guernica was far more stunning in person than I expected), but the Dalis and Miros were great. They even had a film by Luis Bunuel. Truly an astounding collection of the last century's world class art, especially, of course, Spanish art. Thinking about the collection that I saw actually excites me, just as I was excited to find a Richard Serra installation there.<br>Really worth a visit!!!!!<br>And, students are free!",339,"Amazing Museum.
